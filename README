Processing Layer Code

  This code (Arduino Sketch),for Arduino, processing layer microcontroller, running the emmeded systems devices 
  of the AQEM. This layer, processing layer, handles interfacing with the physical devices of the AQEM; 
  reading air quality and enviormental sensor, displaying sensor values through a onboard display system, 
  processing simple edge computing services(filtering and basic calculations), communicating sensor values 
  and proccessed decisions over WiFi. 

Getting Started

	This code must be uploaded to a Arduino Mega and have the required connects and sheilds instand on the Arduino.

	Prerequisites

		1. Processing layer board is installed to the Arduino Mega.
		2. Upload Arduino Sketch to Arduino Mega via Arduino IDE.
